# Secure Information Store Project


This JavaFX project is a complete rewrite of my previous repository, 
accountLogging. 
It builds upon the 
original by incorporating numerous new features, with a focus on
improving maintainability and readability through the use of design patterns.

Protect your account information with AES-256 encryption, 
where the encryption key is securely stored in a file. 
This key also safeguards sensitive data through the text 
entries feature. Titles and textual information are encrypted 
using AES-GCM for robust security, while tags employ AES-ECB to 
enable efficient searchability. The appâ€™s encryptor window allows you to 
generate multiple keys for securing different messages. 
These keys can encrypt text, which can then be saved to text files or other storage media.
Additionally, the project offers file encryption, providing a reliable way to securely store your files.
